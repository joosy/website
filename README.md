## Hacking

We use [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) as a building platform so if you want to play with content helping us to improve, here's what you should do:

  1. Ensure you have [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/) and [Bundler](http://bundler.io) installed.
  2. Clone the repo and run `bundle install` at its root.
  3. Run `rake server` to start local server at [port 4000](http://localhost:4000).
  4. Modify whatever you want – changes will automatically precompile. Note that it sometimes take a bit of time (2-3 seconds) to compile big files even if all you changed is one symbol. So keep patience if the modification didn't reflect in browser immediately.
  5. Once you are happy with modifications – submit a pull request! :bow:
